== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

On request, your content is sent securely to Janey's servers for analysis. Janey uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify key concepts, scored on relevancy. The results are stored in your Wordpress site, and displayed in the WP Admin. With a few clicks you can select terms to add to the post and set one of Janey's recommended photos as the post thumbnail.

= How much does it cost? =

The plugin allows you to control when, and how often, you make requests to analyze your content. Analysis results are stored as post metadata in your Wordpress site. With the right plugin settings, you can easily optimize your requests to only pennies per post. Pricing information is available at [https://janey.ai/pricing/](https://janey.ai/pricing/). Note: there's no cost for the Unsplash image search requests.

= Is taxonomy good for SEO? =

When done correctly, organized content improves user experience. Unfortunately, terms are often selected arbitrarily based on the subjective preferences of the publisher, or speculation on the potential SEO impact. Janey AI eliminates these judgement calls, reducing effort and cognitive load for the content creator. The benefits of intuitive taxonomy are evident **when the structure and terms are of high quality**. NLP provides highly relevant terms that describe content **consistently**, in a way that both machines and humans understand.

= Does Janey AI work with Gutenberg? =

Functionally, Janey AI fully supports Gutenberg, the new Wordpress 5.x editor. Upon publishing or updating a published post, you'll be prompted to reload the editor page in order to view Janey AI's updates to the metadata and taxonomies. Full support for Gutenberg's SPA architecture is coming soon.
